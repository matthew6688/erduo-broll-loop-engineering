## Real output demo

</p>

This 12-second concept film travels through one continuous world: SRT timing, semantic direction and frozen material, deterministic backend routing, then preview approval and a technically verified 4K master. Generated environment assets share one art direction; typography and camera motion are deterministic HyperFrames animation. It demonstrates the production path, not the output of a particular user SRT or a claim of visual parity between backends.

## What it does

- Converts integer-millisecond SRT timing into semantic shots rather than one shot per subtitle.
- Freezes a shared visual system and compact shot recipes before implementation.
- Defaults production to HyperFrames; Remotion is explicit/canary-only and `auto` is experimental opt-in.
- Uses supplied media first and sources extra material only when a shot requires it.
- Shows three final Lead samples and a five-shot user-choice canary before full production, directly renders each semantic shot, creates a six-frame sheet per shot, and assembles the preview from verified files.

### Enforced brand and workflow governance

When a user names a brand authority or fixed workflow, Parent first creates a
non-overwritable governance contract and lock. A `design` gate runs before
Director, planning automatically runs the `director` gate, and every standard
render automatically runs the `source` gate. The same hash-bound authorities,
original design, approved logos, palette, fonts, prohibited styles, and stage
order are propagated into the Runtime Plan and every Builder assignment. Drift
fails closed and requires a new production root; a manual checklist cannot
substitute for these gates. Full production still waits for at least 3 of 5
user-selected canary shots.

## v1.0.1: Restore the Chapter Builder Loop

v1.0.1 is released. A semantic shot is still one independently decoded H.264 media boundary, while one Chapter Builder now owns the creative loop for normally 5–8 contiguous shots. It reads the complete original SRT and design, cannot change `truth`, may revise `creativeProposal` with one concise reason, and owns chapter composition, material, pacing, and seams.

Assets freezes known shared media/fonts without closing shot-specific `search`, `generate`, or `mixed` routes. Lead must build three final samples—native graphic/type, real-or-generated material fusion, and information-dense interface/process/data—plus the design's signature motion, fusion capabilities, and a short capability index. Every Chapter Builder must open the real six-frame sheets and chapter preview, repair defects, and return `accepted` or `revised`.

Production source no longer carries `inspection.tsx`, DOM trace markers, manual motion windows, or passing dense diagnostics. Parent owns deterministic render/decode/hash/contracts/sheets/preview. The positive twelve principles are a short role anchor; each shot selects only 2–4 relevant `craftIntent` values, with no score or proof work.

Production defaults to HyperFrames. Remotion is explicit opt-in or canary-only; `auto` is experimental opt-in. A five-shot canary must pass direct delivery, real Builder viewing, composition/material/signature-motion diversity, user preference of at least 3/5, and a ≤45-minute first preview before full production may start.

The 2026-08-18 179.866-second Remotion run remains failure evidence: 20/20 media contracts and decode passed, but it created 20 creative units, withheld the original design, used little material, and passing technical inspection did not produce acceptable visual quality. Its 203m13s / 54m17s / 63m13s timings also missed targets. It does not validate this reset or equal backends.

## v1.0.0 Visual Lock Before Bulk Production

- Director shots normally target about 5–12 seconds of complete meaning. Runtime Plan v3 independently groups several short shots into each Builder unit; 2–3 Builders is the planning target for an ordinary 180-second single-backend film, not a forced quota.
- A Lead Builder first produces one opening, one information-dense, and one late representative scene plus importable visual source for each actual backend. The user approves, requests revision, or explicitly skips the lock before remaining Builders fan out.
- Ordinary single-backend units default to high-quality H.264 MP4 (`libx264 / medium / CRF 12`). FFV1 remains an explicit, reason-bound upgrade for Hybrid, transparency, or a real lossless exchange need.
- Motion/layout checks sample beat boundaries, readable holds, cuts, and necessary points first. Only findings and inherently precise diagrams or paths escalate to dense traces; passing work does not generate full-film frame PNGs.
- Public-safe production metrics cover stage time, Agent calls, units, files/bytes, render/trace/decode/hash work, failures/retries, and optional host token facts. Missing token facts remain unknown and are never estimated from private session storage.

The [v1.0.0 public production benchmark](docs/V1.0.0-BENCHMARK.md) now records one real Codex run on the same 179.866-second SRT: 20 Shot Recipe v3 files, one Lead plus three production Builders, 10 Agent calls, zero full-history calls, no external assets, 213 files, and 156,980 KiB of disk use. Preview and master passed full decode. Director start to first preview took about 242.05 minutes, missing the 120-minute target; Lead took 62.90 minutes, missing the 45-minute target. One Director visual-lock rejection was fixed and rechecked, but the user did not watch or approve the aesthetics, so visual lock is `skipped`. Host tokens are unknown, A/V sync was not tested, and the same-input Claude Code comparison remains pending.

## v0.9.2 Same Production, Safer Installation

v0.9.2 changes packaging and installation only. Director, Assets, multiple Builders, 152 Shotcraft cards, eight diagram grammars, runtime routing, preview approval, and delivery contracts are unchanged from v0.9.1. The standard Skill archive excludes the environment bootstrapper, test fixtures, and release tooling; the full archive keeps the pinned one-click environment setup.

## v0.9.1 Creative Production and Clearer Diagrams

- Keeps one Director, one Assets role, and multiple focused Builders. It does not reduce animation to fixed templates or restrict composition, metaphor, or motion complexity.
- The Parent directly runs deterministic scripts for backend planning, task dispatch, validation, clip assembly, and preview preparation, with no Runtime Planner, Integrator, or Render Agent. One production shares assets and identical dependencies instead of copying complete projects.
- Each Builder delivers editable source plus a validated video clip with a common profile. Scripts concatenate the clips; they do not claim to understand or merge arbitrary HyperFrames and Remotion source.
- The complete preview is capped at 1080p and encoded with `veryfast / CRF 22`. Its approval identity binds the runtime plan, narrative envelope, visual system, every shot contract, and the actual clip hashes.
- Delivery must pass `--plan`, `--narrative-envelope`, `--visual-system`, and every `--contract` again. It rechecks identity and creates the full-spec `medium / CRF 16` master from frozen clips; it never copies the preview as the master.
- Turns spoken meaning and emotion into animation beats. Builders must make the subject, space, hierarchy, relationships, or visual focus visibly develop; decorative loops do not count as the main animation.
- When speech depends on process, cause, time order, hierarchy, feedback, dependency, a system route, or aligned comparison, the Director may select one of eight compact diagram grammars. There is no diagram quota, external full Skill load, or fixed visual skin.
- Builders still design space, material, and motion from the film's visual system. Runtime-captured checks only reject connectors crossing unrelated nodes, labels touching paths or nodes, shared connector paths, and canvas escape; they do not score the diagram style.
- Sends targeted revisions back to the responsible Builder without giving every Builder the full production history.

The checks can flag missing planned development and measurable motion/layout risks. They cannot judge whether animation is sophisticated or make an aesthetic decision. Visual lock controls bulk fan-out; the complete moving preview controls delivery. Cross-backend visual parity is not claimed.

## Install

### Standard Skill install

Use this on a machine that already has the pinned HyperFrames environment and only needs the fourteen project Skills registered in one host. Download `erduo-broll-loop-engineering-skills-v1.0.1.tar.gz` from the [v1.0.1 Release](https://github.com/erduo1998-cell/erduo-broll-loop-engineering/releases/tag/v1.0.1), extract it into a permanent directory, then run:

```bash
npx -y skills@1.5.22 add ./erduo-broll-loop-engineering-skills-1.0.1 --skill '*' --agent codex --global --full-depth
# replace codex with claude-code for Claude Code
```

This path uses the Skills CLI universal host store and does not execute this repository's one-click environment bootstrapper. It never silently prepares Node, a browser, or FFmpeg and never reduces production capability. If Node 22.20+, FFmpeg/FFprobe, the pinned HyperFrames runtime, its eight official Skills, or its browser are missing, preflight stops and the full install below is required.

### Full environment install

Use this for a first install or when machine readiness is unknown.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthew6688/erduo-broll-loop-engineering.git
cd erduo-broll-loop-engineering
./Install.command
```

Restart your host after installation. The installer provisions the pinned HyperFrames environment and thirteen stage Skills. It does not use `sudo`, edit your shell profile, or install Remotion globally. The same full package is available as `erduo-broll-loop-engineering-v1.0.1.tar.gz` on the v1.0.1 Release.

## First run

Attach the complete original SRT and design, then ask:

```text
Use erduo-broll-loop-engineering to turn this complete original SRT and design into editable faceless B-roll shot files and a complete preview; create a full master only if I request it.
Continue unattended through the five-shot canary, then stop for my per-shot choice; do not start full production until I choose this version for at least three of five shots. Stop again for final-preview delivery approval.
```

Talking-head mode also requires the matching edited video. Your images, clips, logos, and screenshots are optional but should be supplied at the start when available.

## Language support

UTF-8 SRT input is not restricted to Chinese. Actual language quality depends on the host model's understanding and on project fonts covering the required glyphs. Full subtitles are not burned into the default B-roll master.

## Verified scope

- Codex completed the v1.0.0 production benchmark on macOS. Claude Code installation/contracts are covered, but its same-input v1 production comparison remains pending.
- v1.0.1 default delivery: ordered H.264 shot files, 1920 × 1080, 30 fps, each rendered directly from runtime source; 4K is explicit opt-in and a full master is optional.
- A fresh same-input five-shot HyperFrames canary passed direct render, full decode, viewing receipts, composition/material diversity, and signature-motion gates. The user approved the result and explicitly chose to publish without producing the remaining shots or a full preview. Full-film production and equal-backend support are therefore not claimed.
- Output policy is generated by `create-production-profile.mjs`, never hand-written. The Parent always passes that file to `plan-runtime.mjs --production-profile`; explicit width, height, fps, audio, and H.264 MP4 policy are hash-bound into the plan, every Builder assignment, and delivery checks. For example, `--width 1080 --height 1920 --fps 25 --audio silent --master-format h264-mp4` creates a vertical 25 fps profile instead of falling back to the default.
- HyperFrames and Remotion are independent backends; visual parity is not claimed.
- Windows, desktop CapCut/Jianying import, and automatic repair of arbitrary existing projects are not verified.
- The complete technical contract and troubleshooting guide remain in the [Simplified Chinese README](README.md).
